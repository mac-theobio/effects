Make a good plot showing the advantage of model center when fitting interactions. I think we should be able to do this with varpred.
* Maybe works now, but doesn't apply to focal-only interactions
* Write focal interaction notes and discuss in paper
* Make non-focal interaction example for paper
* Go home and get some rest!!
