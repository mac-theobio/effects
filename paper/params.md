eco.R is the original, and I've messed with it a lot. The logic here is not particularly clear

straight.R is a merge with Bicko; trying to figure out the gap between his good bias-correction and my struggles

high.R has been repurposed as an attempt to get JD machinery working with Bicko-like parameters.
